            <article>
              <p>Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to
              guide complete beginners to web development with all that they
              need to start coding websites.</p>
                <p> The aim of this area of MDN is not
              to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from
              "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to
              start making your way, learning from the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">rest of MDN</a>, and other
              intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous
              knowledge.</p>
              <p> If you are a complete beginner, web development can be
              challenging â€” we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for
              you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should
              feel at home whether you are a student learning web development
              on your own or as part of a class, a teacher looking for class
              materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand
              more about how web technologies work.</p>
